# hermes-x-bookmarks

A [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) plugin that reads all your X
bookmarks, including long posts, threads and X Articles, sorts them with your own Hermes model and
exports them: a board on your Desktop, notes in Obsidian, a Notion database or a Google Doc.

```
/xbm sync       pull your bookmarks from X (the first run reads all of them)
/xbm classify   sort them: category, tags, kind, one-line summary, priority
/xbm export     write them out: desktop, obsidian, notion, gdocs (or all)
/xbm digest     the week in your bookmarks: the best ones numbered, 3 post ideas
/xbm schedule   get that digest every Sunday in this chat; reply "task 3" or "skill 2"
```

Works in any Hermes chat (`/xbm ...`) and in the terminal (`hermes xbm ...`).
Uses the official X API only: no scraping, no browser automation, read-only access.

## Fork hardening and a limited trial

This fork (`yijingman/hermes-x-bookmarks`, based on `winchxyz/hermes-x-bookmarks`) makes two
narrow changes:

- Digest reply hooks identify posts using validated ASCII numeric post IDs, not untrusted
  article titles, summaries, post text or URLs. Tool arguments still use the digest item number.
- Unscheduling retains the job ID and reports uncertainty on errors or unconfirmed removal.
  Only an explicit successful removal clears it; a free-text "not found" error does not.

For an initial trial, use the capped **CLI** command instead of an uncapped chat sync:

```bash
hermes xbm sync --max-pages 1
hermes xbm status
```

No schedule is created automatically by default. Leave `/xbm schedule` and automation
blueprints unused during the trial. The page cap limits bookmark pagination, **not total
requests or cost**: identity lookup and missing-article enrichment may make additional calls.
Set spending limits with both X and your model provider before any live trial; local cost
estimates are not budget enforcement. Review the stored sample before classification or export.

Remaining concerns are unchanged: full threads are not fetched; deletions on X are not
reconciled locally; article enrichment depends on API availability and can cost extra.
Obsidian export writes into a vault and preserves existing note bodies, so later enrichment
may not appear in those bodies. Trial exports in a separate backed-up vault and review
untrusted Markdown, links and embeds before using your primary vault. These fixes do not
make all model processing or generated skills immune to prompt injection; review drafts
before saving.

## What it does

- **Sync.** Reads every bookmark the X API returns, newest first. The full text of X Articles
  (your bookmark is the Article, or quotes one) and long posts comes with it. Later syncs read small
  pages and stop as soon as they reach bookmarks already stored.
- **Sort.** Your Hermes model labels each bookmark: a category from your list, up to 5 tags, a kind
  (read, try, task, post-idea, reference, skill-candidate), a one-sentence summary, a priority
  (1-3) and why you probably saved it. Ten bookmarks per model call; nothing is sorted twice.
  Post text is passed to the model as data, never as instructions.
- **Desktop board.** `board.html` is one self-contained page: search, filters, columns by
  category, kind or priority, a "done" mark per card (kept in that browser). `bookmarks.md` is the
  same list as Markdown, grouped by category.
- **Obsidian.** One note per bookmark in your vault's `X Bookmarks` folder, with front matter
  (category, tags, kind, priority, summary, status) and the full post or Article text, plus an
  `X Bookmarks.base` table. Later exports update only the plugin's keys: your `status`, your own
  keys and anything you write in the note stay.
- **Notion.** A database "X Bookmarks" under a page you choose, with boards by category and by
  status. One page per bookmark with the text, quote, image and a link card. Re-exports update
  only what changed and never touch `Status` (yours to move); pages you delete stay deleted.
- **Google Docs.** One document "X Bookmarks", grouped by category, highest priority first, with
  links. Each export rewrites the same document, so its link and sharing stay.

- **Digest.** `/xbm digest` covers the bookmarks stored in the last 7 days: counts per category,
  a 2-3 sentence overview, the 10 best ones numbered (highest priority first, your own posts left
  out) and 3 ideas for your own posts. The overview and ideas come from your model, in your
  summary language; without a model you still get the numbered list.
- **Weekly, in your chat.** `/xbm schedule` creates an ordinary Hermes cron job (default: every
  Sunday 6pm, `/xbm schedule every monday 9am` to change it). Each week it syncs, writes the
  digest and posts it to the chat you set it up from, or stays quiet when nothing is new. It is
  also in Hermes' blueprint gallery as "X bookmarks weekly digest". `/xbm unschedule` removes it.
- **Act on an item.** Reply to the digest with "task 3", or use `/xbm task 3 [note]`: the
  bookmark becomes a task (`/xbm tasks`, `/xbm done 1`). "skill 2" or `/xbm skill 2` drafts a
  Hermes skill from that post (steps, pitfalls, how to check) and shows it; `/xbm skill 2 save`
  creates it through Hermes' own `skill_manage`, where Hermes may ask you to approve it. Posts
  with no repeatable procedure get no skill. Your notes stay in the exports above.

## Setup

### 1. Your own X developer app

Every user brings their own X app and pays X for their own reads; nothing goes through a shared
app.

1. Sign in at [console.x.com](https://console.x.com) with the X account whose bookmarks you want.
   That account must own the app (that is what makes the "owned reads" price apply).
2. Create an app on the **Pay-per-use** plan, add credit and set a spending limit.
3. In the app's user authentication settings, set permissions to **Read**.
4. On **Keys and tokens**, copy the **API Key** and **API Key Secret**, then generate the
   **Access Token** and **Access Token Secret** (after setting Read, so they carry it).

### 2. Keys into Hermes

Put the four values in your Hermes profile's `.env` (`~/.hermes/.env`; on Windows
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\.env`):

```
XBM_X_API_KEY=...
XBM_X_API_SECRET=...
XBM_X_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
XBM_X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=...
```

The plugin reads them through Hermes' secret scope and never writes them anywhere. To revoke,
regenerate the tokens on X.

### 3. Install

```bash
hermes plugins install yijingman/hermes-x-bookmarks --enable
hermes xbm whoami
```

`whoami` should print your handle. Then:

```bash
hermes xbm sync
hermes xbm classify --all
hermes xbm export
```

### 4. Export destinations (optional)

**Obsidian.** Nothing to set up if Obsidian has your vault open: the plugin finds it in
Obsidian's own `obsidian.json`. Otherwise set `obsidian_vault` to the vault folder. Then
`hermes xbm export obsidian`.

**Notion** goes through Hermes' own Notion connector: no token, no Notion app of your own.

1. Connect Hermes to Notion once (opens the browser to sign in):

   ```bash
   hermes mcp install notion
   ```

2. Let this plugin use that connection. In your Hermes `config.yaml` (`~/.hermes/config.yaml`;
   on Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\config.yaml`) add:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     entries:
       hermes-x-bookmarks:
         mcp_allowlist: ["notion"]
   ```

   Hermes gives a plugin no MCP access unless you list the server here.
3. Make (or pick) a Notion page for the database, then in a Hermes chat:
   `/xbm export notion <that page's URL>` (the URL is remembered as `notion_page`).
   One export writes everything (25 pages per request; about 1,900 bookmarks take a few
   minutes) and shows its progress in the chat. Running it again sends only what changed.

Without the connector (an older Hermes, or a terminal where it is not connected), the plugin can
use a Notion connection token instead: create an **internal** connection at
[notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) with Read, Update and
Insert content, put its token in the Hermes `.env` as `XBM_NOTION_TOKEN=...`, add the connection
to the page (**••• → Connections**), and run `hermes xbm export notion <page URL>`. Both routes
write the same database and know which pages already exist.

**Google Docs.**

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) create a project and enable
   the **Google Docs API**.
2. **Google Auth Platform → Branding**: app name and your email. **Audience**: External, add
   yourself as a test user, then **Publish app** (In production); in Testing, Google ends the
   sign-in after 7 days. With only the `drive.file` scope no verification is needed; Google shows
   an "unverified app" screen once, which you can pass for your own app.
3. **Clients → Create client → Desktop app**. Put both values in the Hermes `.env`:
   `XBM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...` and `XBM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...`
4. `hermes auth add hermes-x-bookmarks:google` (opens the browser once), then
   `hermes xbm export gdocs`.

`drive.file` lets the plugin see and change only the document it created, nothing else in your
Drive.

Set `export_to` (for example `desktop, obsidian, notion`) to choose what a plain `export` does.

## Settings

Set in the Hermes Plugins settings, or with `/xbm about` for the last one.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `categories` | AI & agents, Coding & dev tools, Crypto & web3, Business & growth, Design & art, Learning & guides, News & opinion, Life & misc | Your category list, comma-separated. "Other" is always added. |
| `classify_language` | English | Language of summaries and the why-saved note |
| `about_me` | empty | A sentence on what you build and follow; used only to judge priority (`/xbm about <text>`) |
| `export_to` | desktop | What a plain `export` writes: desktop, obsidian, notion, gdocs |
| `export_dir` | `X Bookmarks` on your Desktop | Where `export desktop` writes |
| `obsidian_vault` | the vault Obsidian has open | Vault folder; notes go to `X Bookmarks/` in it |
| `notion_page` | empty | The Notion page that holds the database |
| `auth_backend` | auto | `keys` (above), `hermes` (OAuth 2.0 via `hermes auth add hermes-x-bookmarks:x`) or `xurl` |

Sorting runs on the plugin's own model slot, **X bookmarks: sorting**. It uses your main model
until you pick another one in `hermes model` (auxiliary tasks). A stronger model gives clearly
better priorities and fewer odd categories.

## Commands

| Chat | Terminal | |
|---|---|---|
| `/xbm sync [full]` | `hermes xbm sync [--full]` | Pull new bookmarks (`full` re-reads all) |
| `/xbm classify [N\|all]` | `hermes xbm classify [--limit N \| --all]` | Sort unsorted bookmarks (chat: 20 by default, max 100) |
| `/xbm export [where]` | `hermes xbm export [where] [--dir PATH]` | `desktop`, `obsidian`, `notion [page URL]`, `gdocs`, `all`; several allowed |
| `/xbm status` | `hermes xbm status` | Counts, categories, last runs, X API and model use |
| `/xbm list [N] [category]` | `hermes xbm list [--limit N] [--category C]` | Most recent bookmarks with their labels |
| `/xbm about [text\|clear]` | `hermes xbm about [text]` | Show or set what you build and follow |
| `/xbm digest [days]` | `hermes xbm digest [days]` | Digest of the last 7 (or N) days, items numbered |
| `/xbm task N [note]` | `hermes xbm task N [note]` | Make item N of the latest digest a task (also a post id or x.com link) |
| `/xbm tasks`, `/xbm done N` | `hermes xbm tasks`, `hermes xbm done N` | Open tasks; finish task N |
| `/xbm skill N [save]` | `hermes xbm skill N [save]` | Draft a Hermes skill from item N; `save` creates it |
| `/xbm schedule [when]` | | Weekly digest as a Hermes cron job in this chat (default `every sunday 6pm`) |
| `/xbm unschedule` | `hermes xbm unschedule` | Remove that cron job |

In a chat you can also just answer a digest: "task 3", "skill 2", "done 1". The agent has
three tools for it: `xbm_digest`, `xbm_task` and `xbm_skill` (toolset `x_bookmarks`). Hermes
does not show a slash command's output to the agent, so when your whole message is such a reply
and you had a digest in the last 8 days, the plugin's `pre_llm_call` hook adds one line to that
message naming the item and the tool. Any other message is left alone.

## Cost

- **X API** (paid to X, on your app). Reading your own bookmarks is an "owned read": about
  **$0.001 per post**. The author's first full sync of 1,880 bookmarks took 22 requests and about
  **$1.89**; a sync with nothing new reads 10 posts, about $0.01. From 2026-11-22 X also bills
  the expanded objects that come with each page (authors, images, quoted posts): on the same
  1,880 bookmarks that is about 3,650 more objects, so a full sync costs roughly 3x.
  `/xbm status` shows an estimate per run.
- **Model** (your provider). Sorting 1,880 bookmarks took 188 calls, about 500k input and 200k
  output tokens. On a free model that was $0. A digest is one model call (up to 60 one-line
  summaries in), a skill draft one call; both use the `xbm_digest` model slot. The weekly cron
  job itself runs on your main model, which mostly just passes the digest on.

## Privacy, network and files

What the plugin touches, so you know before installing:

- **Network.** `api.x.com` (your bookmarks, read-only) and your Hermes model provider (sorting).
  Only when you export there: Notion through Hermes' Notion connector (the `notion` MCP server,
  only if you list it in `mcp_allowlist`; it creates the database, its two boards and the pages,
  and updates those pages) or `api.notion.com` with your token, and `docs.googleapis.com` through
  Hermes' Google sign-in. Nothing else, no telemetry.
- **Data.** Bookmarks, labels, run history, export ids, digests, tasks and skill drafts live in
  Hermes plugin data (SQLite) on your machine. No keys or tokens are stored there.
- **Hermes objects it creates, only when you ask.** `/xbm schedule` creates one Hermes cron job
  (it keeps running if you disable the plugin; `/xbm unschedule` or Hermes' cron tools remove
  it). `/xbm skill N save` creates one Hermes skill through `skill_manage`. Both are ordinary
  Hermes objects you can edit or delete.
- **Credentials.** The X keys and the optional Notion token are read from the Hermes `.env`
  through Hermes' secret scope; the Notion connector, X OAuth 2.0 and Google sign-ins are kept
  and refreshed by Hermes.
  The plugin never writes a credential.
- **Files outside plugin data.** `export desktop` writes `X Bookmarks/` on your Desktop (or
  `export_dir`); `export obsidian` writes notes into your vault's `X Bookmarks/` folder and reads
  Obsidian's `obsidian.json` to find the vault (vault paths only).
- **Hook.** `pre_llm_call` reads your message only to check whether it is just "task N",
  "skill N" or "done N"; only then it opens plugin data and adds a short note (see Commands).
- **Commands.** None, unless you choose the `xurl` sign-in, which runs `xurl token`.
- Post text goes to the model you configured in Hermes and to the destinations you export to.

## Limits

- X Article bodies come from the API as plain text (no headings, links or images inside).
- Threads: each bookmarked post is stored on its own; the rest of the thread is not fetched yet.
- Removing a bookmark on X does not yet remove it here.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e . -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff check .
pytest -q
```

Design and research notes: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
[docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md), [docs/research/](docs/research/).
CI runs ruff, pytest, and `hermes plugins validate` / `doctor` against Hermes v0.23.0 and main.
